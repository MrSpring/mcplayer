MC Music Player
========

MC Music Player is a LiteLoader mod, which allows you to play music from in-game.
It's still in planning and VERY early development. Nothing is promised to actually come out of this project.
You are free to look around the code and maybe pop in with a pull request/issue if you have anything you want to tell me.
